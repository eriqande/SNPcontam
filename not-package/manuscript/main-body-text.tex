\section*{Introduction}

Some free-form thoughts.

The past half decade has seen the emergence of a number of cost-effective methods for genotyping
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for molecular ecology studies.  For example, \ldots.
In the management of commercially important species like Pacific salmon, SNPs have been used, blah, blah.
10's of thousands of individuals genotyped every year at a fraction of the cost of microsatellites (give 
a ballpark estimate of how much less expensive, at least from our lab).  The application of such technologies 
is now becoming more commonplace amongst other species.  (WIWA's for example).  

Next generation sequencing technologies, and the allure of genotyping by sequencing on such platforms: this
may well  become the way everything is done in the future, but the relative simplicity of platforms like the 
Fluidigm make those very attractive.  Also good for low-quantity DNA, large number of individuals, degraded 
tissues, etc.  It is likely that
