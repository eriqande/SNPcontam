# here are some links to articles we should read

*  *Detecting and Estimating Contamination of Human DNA Samples in Sequencing and Array-Based Genotype Data*
This is an article in AJHG from Boehnke's group.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487130/  It is geared toward human stuff for sure and combines array and sequencing methods.


*  *Here is a google scholar "related-articles" search for the above*  http://scholar.google.com/scholar?bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.67720277,d.cGU,pv.xjs.s.en_US.u4s5c7_Kv3Q.O&biw=1381&bih=738&dpr=1&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr=&q=related:Vk_ZjMpPmK3cIM:scholar.google.com/


* *ContEst: estimating cross-contamination of humnan samples next-generation sequencing data* 
http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/18/2601  As the title says this is geared towards human sequencing. Bayesian approah to calculate the posterior probability of the contamination level.


* *A Novel Method for Detecting Contaminated Samples Based on Illumina Sequencing Data*
http://www.ijbbb.org/papers/322-E0014.pdf  Model for detecting contamination using mappability of sites and SNP sites on the X and Y chromosomes.
