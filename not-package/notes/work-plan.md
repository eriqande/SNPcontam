## 1. Literature Review
* Search for previous research on identifying contaminated samples
* Explore research focused on dealing with non-ideal samples (fecal matter, hair samples, etc.)

## 2. Likelihood Ratio Test
### Question
How much better is the likelihood ratio test than using heterozygousity to determine contaminiation?

### Method
#### Develop Ratio Test
* $\Lambda= log(\frac{p(\theta|con)}{p(\theta | noncon)})$ 

#### Develop Heterozygosity Test

#### Comparison
* Use a Receiver Operator Characteristic curve (ROC) to find the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the two different methods.
* The better test will have a greater AUC

## 3. Lab Work and Familiarity
* Become familiar with scoring DNA and recording results

## 4. Design Lab Experiment
* Design Experiment with Anthony to explore relationship between contamination, amount of DNA, etc. 

## 5. Run Experiment
* Once experiment is designed and decided that it is worth doing, titrate some plates of DNA.

## 6. MCMC to Determine Allele Frequency in Contaminated Samples

## 7. Presentation of Results
