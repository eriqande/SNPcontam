%Abstract
\section*{Abstract} 
NOAA Fisheries laboratories have pioneered the use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes to identify stocks of commercially important fish species, such as Pacific salmon, and have demonstrated that SNPs outperform previously-used microsatellite genotypes on the basis of cost, resolution, and ease of standardization. However widespread adoption of SNP genotyping for fisheries management has been hindered by concerns that the biallelic nature of SNPs makes it difficult to identify contaminated samples. Here, we present an accurate statistical method for identifying contaminated samples from SNP genotype data and tailor it to two data scenarios commonly encountered in fisheries management: 1) sampling of genotypes for a single population, and 2) sampling of genotypes from a mixture of individuals from different populations (such as in a mixed fishery). We present two different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for determining the proportion and identity of contaminated samples in single population and mixture scenarios. We tested the single population model with 100 simulations of in silico data generated from observed Pacific Chinook salmon (\textit{Oncorhynchus tshawytscha}) allele frequencies, and we tested the mixture model with simulations using a mixture of individuals sampled from previously genotyped Chinook salmon baseline data. Using 60 or more loci, the single population algorithm identified over 98 percent of contaminated while falsely identifying less than 0.28 percent of samples.  Similarly, the mixture model algorithm successfuly identified the majority of contaminated samples while producing few false positives.
