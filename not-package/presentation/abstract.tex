\section*{Abstract} 
This talk will present algorithms for identifying contaminated samples genotyped with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for both single population and stock mixture models. The use of SNPs has recently emerged as cost-effective alternative to microsatellite genotyping and an important tool for the management of commercially important fish species, like Pacific salmon.  However, the biallelic nature of SNPs make it very difficult to identifying contaminated samples from the genotype data.  We developed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for determining the proportion of contaminated samples and identifying contaminated samples using genotype data, while also determining the allele frequencies from a single population and the mixture proportions from a mixture of populations.  We tested the single population and mixture models using simulated data from observed allele frequencies and baseline data respectively.  The simulation results from the single population model indicate that our algorithms identify over 98 percent of contaminated samples with over 60 loci, while falsely identifying less than 0.28 percent of samples.
