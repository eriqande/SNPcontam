# SNPcontam

This is an R package with some code implementing methods under development
to detect contaminated samples from SNP genotyes sampled in molecular
ecology contexts.  

Currently, the directory `not-package` contains things that will not go into
the final R package.  This includes the manuscript that we will be preparing
and several readings and resources.  

To typeset the manuscript (which is really just a stub at this point)
`cd` into the `not-package/manuscript` directory and issue this
command (note that you have to have a TeX system installed on your
system):
```
latexmk -pdf snp-contam-main
```
The resulting PDF file, `snp-contam-main` should then be complete.

## Terms 

As a work partially of the United States Government, this package is in the
public domain within the United States. 

Of course, it would be awfully lame of anyone to take anything found within
here and use it as their own before we tried publishing any of this, should
we choose to do that.

See TERMS.md for more information.
